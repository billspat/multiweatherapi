# Rainwise Weather Stations

### Authentication

Rainwise weather station API does not require real-time authentication process; however end-user/station owners must go through registration process with the Rainwise. By doing so, Rainwise will assign end-user/station owners unique `sid`/`pid` that is required for making API call

> NOTE: Rainwise does provide **public API** that does **not** require registration. The public API has limitation and is intended for accessing current conditions and short period of historical data

### Endpoint in Action

   - Sample output [JSON File](https://michiganstate.sharepoint.com/sites/Geography-EnviroweatherTeam/_layouts/15/download.aspx?UniqueId=b15e7ca07c2b48aca994aaaaebfe7ba0&e=LOoBjP) may be viewed from the project [SharePoint Folder](https://michiganstate.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/Geography-EnviroweatherTeam/Shared%20Documents/Data%20on%20Demand/ADS%20ENVWX%20API%20Project/Vendor%20API%20and%20station%20info/Sample%20Weather%20Data%20Output?csf=1&web=1&e=w3tnnc).
   - Start and End date/time is expected to be in ***Local Time zone***
   
   > NOTE: If `sdate` and `edate` are **not** set, it returns the **last 24 hours**â€™ worth of data from the current date and time, otherwise the data between the specified ranges is returned. The date range for data is **limited to 7 days** for an interval of **1 minute**. This limit scales with the interval so with an interval of **15 minutes**, the limit will be **105 days**.
