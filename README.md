# Multi Weather API

Consistent Python bindings for select commercial weather station APIs, such as [Zentra Cloud](https://zentracloud.com/) REST API v3, created for MSU EnviroWeather Project.

### Background

This is inspired by python bindings for v1 of the Zentra API from the Montana Climate office : MSU Agricultural Weather Office


The EnviroWeather system from the MSU Agricultural Weather Office will interface with weather stations (select list of vendors) deployed and owned privately. Since each vendor has a differrent REST/Web API to access station's weather data, this package aims to provide a consistent interface to all of those stations in order to make it easy for incoporating them into a data pipeline.
